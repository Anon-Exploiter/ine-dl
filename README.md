**Python script to download INE courses including labs, exercises, quizzes, slides, and, videos!**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18597330/179950027-c5856feb-bec0-4d32-bae9-0998fbb715a8.png" />


### Requirements

- Python (3.6.* - 3.8.*)
- Python `pip3`
- Python module `requests_toolbelt`
- Python module `requests`
- Python module `loguru`
- External downloader `aria2`

### How does this script work? (if you want to understand the code)

The script was written based on the APIs of **iOS application** to prevent Google's Invisible captcha implementation hence you will see a header (`X-Ine-Mobile`) hard coded in the script with an static API key required for the IOS API calls to succeed (this is hard-coded in the iOS application binary and can easily be grepped). 

**Initialization:**
1. The script starts with loading the credentials (`username/email` and `password`) from `config.json` file
2. It then proceeds to login into the INE account and loading the `JWT` token into Authorization header to use in next API calls
3. The script then does an API call to download the metadata of all the INE courses present and write into `all_courses_metadata.json`
4. It then checks for the subscriptions the user account has and filters the courses fetched and creates another file named `all_courses_with_access.json` with the data

**Downloading of videos:**
1. Does an API call to fetch the `video name`, `url`, and checks if subtitle URL is present and downloads all those!
2. Also *filters based on the resolution* and goes from 1080, 720 -> low

**Downloading of slides** (format looks like the [following](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18597330/179960035-7a00d727-ebc0-4744-be50-356f53ad03af.png)):
1. An initial request returns the slide metadata containing a link to `index.html` file (with cookies in response headers)
2. We store the cookies and then download `browsersupport.js` and `player.js` files (static can be reused with other slides)
3. INE uses a mix of `css`, `js`, `woff`, and, `pngs` but all have incrementable file names (format differs for text and binary files)
4. Wrote a `while loop` until the incremented file returns 404 and then stops the downloading of category: `CSS/JS/WOFF/PNG`
5. It also downloads any attachments added with the slides.

**Downloading of quizzes** (with right answers):
1. This was quite a pickle, looked into the quiz solving API call, first request returns a `JSON` containing the whole quiz content
2. Second request is a `PUT` request with right/wrong answers from user, in response to this, the JSON body now contains a new key `is_correct` containing the right answer
3. Wrote logic for posting the JSON body taken from the initial request, modified it to required standards, the server doesn't need options to be selected either
4. The `PUT` request then returns the right answers, *two files are made with no answers and correct answers*.

**Downloading of exercises**:
1. This was quite simple, an API call returns the contents in both `Markdown` and `HTML` format
2. For ease of cross-platform usage, I've only stored the `HTML` content with `_exercise_` in file name.

**Downloading of labs**:
1. You lose an edge here, in most of the cases, the labs are stored on INE cloud. 
2. The script only stores the `HTML content` of it (if present)

### Credits

- Inspired as always by downloaders of [r0oth3x49](https://github.com/r0oth3x49)
- Some ideas were taken from [Jayapraveen's downloader](https://github.com/Jayapraveen/INE-courses-downloader). Though his script is nice, it has a lot of bugs, I spent almost 2 holidays fixing those and then thought of writing my own. 

### Note 
Please use the script w.r.t the usage guidelines of INE. Do not exhaust their backend servers. Do not dump and share the courses publicly. 

Please use this on your own risk, If your account is blocked by the usage of this script, I won't be responsible.
